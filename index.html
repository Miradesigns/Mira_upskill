  <h2> Hello, i am Miracle Okonkwo...</h2>
  <article>
    <p>This is a simple website about me and my tech journey! i am an entry-level front-end developer but for now let us dive into how my tech journey began.</p>
    <p>My tech journey didn’t start with a fancy computer or coding bootcamp. It started with curiosity and frustration.<br> I remember the first time I was asked to design something for a friend's business. It was a simple flyer, but I wanted it to look modern and clean. I had no idea where to begin, so I turned to YouTube, downloaded a few free design tools, and just kept experimenting. That small project opened a door. Soon, I was learning about layout, spacing, colors, and typography. That’s how I stumbled into UI/UX design before I even knew what it was called.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;Over time, I began designing mobile app screens and website mockups using tools like Figma and Adobe XD. I enjoyed the process turning rough ideas into something people could see and interact with. But there was always this one thing that bothered me: I couldn’t build what I designed. I had to wait on developers, and sometimes the final product didn’t match what I envisioned. I wanted more control.
     That’s when I decided to learn web development.</p>
    <p>I applied and got accepted into the Genesys Tech Hub training program. It was a big step for me. I was nervous coding felt like a different world. But being there, surrounded by other learners and mentors, gave me the push I needed. I started with HTML and CSS finally seeing my designs come alive in the browser. JavaScript was tough at first, but I stuck with it.
  What keeps me going is the thrill of watching my ideas go from sketches to actual working websites. I’m no longer just a designer I’m becoming a builder. And this is only the beginning..</p>
